VisITMeta
=========

VisITMeta is an *experimental* IF-MAP 2.0/2.1 compliant MAP client written in Java that visualizes metadata stored on a MAP server. It supports features like showing a history of all metadata stored on a MAPS, using filter and search techniques to navigate the metadata as well as some visualization techniques like animations, highlighting and so on. Development was done by Hochschule Hannover (University of Applied Sciences and Arts,  Hanover) within the VisITMeta research project, (support code 17PNT032) which is  funded by the german BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research).
